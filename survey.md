# Pre-workshop survey questions

1) In three sentences or less, please describe your current field of
work or your research area.

2) Have you used R before?

3) What tool(s) do you currently use for doing computer-based
analysis?  (Consider this task: "A tab-delimited file has two columns
showing the date and the highest temperature on that day. Write a
program to produce a graph showing the average highest temperature for
each month."  With which programming languages, if any, could you do
this?)

4) Is there a real-world problem (typically, from your own research)
you would like to see tackled at the workshop?
4.1) Please describe the problem in three sentences or less.
4.2) Can you provide a dataset?  (Before Friday, May 23.)
4.3) Explain in three sentences or less how the problem illustrates an
important point.
4.4) If your problem is selected, will you commit to explaining the goal at the workshop (2-3 minutes, 1 slide)?  (The idea of you saying a few words is to build interest in the question, which you can do better than we could, and also to encourage interaction at the workshop.)

Optional:
5) How familiar are you with version control, if at all?

6) Have you attended other data analysis workshops before?  Which ones?
