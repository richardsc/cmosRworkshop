# A repo for the R workshop to be run 2014-06-01 at CMOS in Rimouski

## Information for participants

The workshop will take place in the "Parent" room at the Hotel Rimouski, from 13:30 to 16:30 (i.e. 1:30pm to 4:30pm EDT). Participants are asked to bring their own laptop, with the following software installed and ready to go:

1. R version 3.1, found at [CRAN][1], or from any of the other mirrors at [CRAN mirrors][2].

2. Rstudio, found at [Rstudio downloads][3]

3. The `oce` (and optionally `ocedata`) package. These can be installed within R, from CRAN, by typing:
```splus
install.packages(c('oce', 'ocedata'))
```

Participants should feel free to bring specific questions and/or data sets, which we could try and address in the workshop.
