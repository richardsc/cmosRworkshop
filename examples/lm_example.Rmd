# Linear models

Create some data, according to the formula
$$
y(x) = x + \epsilon
$$
where $\epsilon$ is normally distributed noise, with a mean of zero and a standard deviation of 2. For the sake of the example, let's introduce a few outliers.

```{r}
set.seed(3)   # makes it reproducible
x <- seq(0, 10, 0.25)
ep <- rnorm(x, sd=2)
II <- c(38:41)
ep[II] <- abs(rnorm(II, sd=50))
y <- x + ep
plot(x, y, pch=21, bg='grey')
grid()
m1 <- lm(y ~ x)
library(MASS)
m2 <- rlm(y ~ x)
abline(m1)
abline(m2, lty=2)
```
