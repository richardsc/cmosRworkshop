# Basic oce object format

`oce` uses S4 objects, with standard "slots" that separate:

* `data`: the data of the object (e.g. temperature, salinity, pressure, etc)

* `metadata`: relevant metadata created from the input file (e.g. instrument parameters, cruise name, lead PI, etc)

* `processingLog`: a log of processing steps, with times, applied to the object (e.g. creation, subsetting, etc)

Within an `oce` object, a particular item can be retrieved using the `[[` method, e.g. to get the temperature from a ctd object:

```{r}
library(oce)
data(ctd)
T <- ctd[['temperature']]
```

The data can also be accessed directly, by following the path through the slots, e.g.

```{r}
slotNames(ctd)
T <- ctd@data$temperature
```

Note that the `@` character is used to designate slots, while `$` is used to designate the elements of each slot (which are themselves "lists"). 

To get a look at the structure of the object, use the `str()` function (for "`str`ucture"):
```{r}
str(ctd)
```
