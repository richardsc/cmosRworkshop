# Meteorological R examples

The examples here were provided by Andrew Teakles and colleagues, Environment Canada (see Rmd or html documents for full credits).

Note that each of the examples require specific data files, which are not provided through this repo due to size limitations. The data will be made available to workshop participants through other means.

## GEM_MACH_Evaluation/

A comparison of GEM-MACH model output and data. 

## windsAndRain/

This example studies the relationship between wind data and high
precipitation events.
 
## HYSPLIT_trajectories/

The example reads HYSPLIT trajectory files and decodes them.  Using
the `plyr` package, it reads an archive of trajectories and then grids
the frequency that a trajectory crosses various raster cells.
